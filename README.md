## The library

The library is a context that I use whenever I want to study/try out a new language, maybe a framework, a library or anything that might apply.

### About the app

This app is just a CRUD for books written in Go.
It's probably not enterprise level code because I'm still learning, but it's my initial view on a backend app.
